        "comment": "Same some years ago, excepting the 3 times.   I got laid off when I was mid 39.   A high end corporate sales job, but in an industry that was at the time (during a recession) generally getting offloaded to Japan/UK.    I spent some months looking for a job in my field.  About 3 months in I got a dream offer.  A move to another large city but working directly for the Sr V.P. of a large international construction company.  He called on Wed to offer me the job and promised to follow up immediately with a written offer letter.   On Saturday I received the offer letter.   On Monday morning first thing I called him.  His asst answered and told me she would transfer me.  Unfortunately she transferred me to the head of HR that informed me that my new boss had been laid off that morning and they were going to have to rescind the offer letter.   At that moment I came to the realization that you have.   I decided no more corporate jobs.   I contacted Merrill Lynch, Coldwell Banker and Prudential.   At the time (1985) the biggest and best in Financial Services, Real Estate and Insurance.   I interviewed them all and picked Prudential, primarily as I was an active golfer and didn't want the weekend work of RE and the stock brokers of that era were all commission based and your gig went to zero every Jan 1.   Insurance  on the other hand paid you half of your commissions up front and than 9 more years of 10% of the gross commissions as 'renewals.'     Today the Financial folks work on % of assets under management so they do have recurring revenue and the insurance folks don't get renewals although their commissions are more front loaded to make up for it.   Today I likely would have gone with ML.    In any commissioned job it takes a bit of time and effort to get going, but I was able to make at least 90% of my previous salary the first 3 years and the 4th I made double my old salary and never looked back.\n\nThink about it.  For every 100 grand a corporation pays you likely you are earning them 200 grand or more.   Why not capture a bit more of that gross for yourself plus earn a whole lot of autonomy.   If you have 200 clients, one or two may fire you, but that doesn't put  you out of work.   \n\nGood luck to you.",

        "comment": "Start with a business plan. Describe who your client is, why they are buying, and where they are. I would spend time describing your production capacity, how is your art produced and how many pieces can you realistically create in a day, week, month, etc. How is your product or service different? Can anyone else doing what you do already, or is there a risk someone can copy your work? What are competitors charging? Can you charge more, less the same?\n\nAt this stage, you don't have a business, you are self employed. That's okay. If you want to grow from being a self employed individual to owning a business with employees, production, who has the possibility of attracting investors or a bank who would lend, you need to answer these questions. There is a possibility your self employed status will never concert into a business, and that's okay, but if you want to be bigger you need to get into detail about these questions. Until then, it will be hard to hire employees, rationalize buying new equipment, and attracting outside capital",

This gives you a foot in the door with the company, learn about the role you're likely to fill and often leads to a hire. Most internships you're finding are likely a semester or so long, as they're meant for college students to try and squeeze work experience in during a college semester of the summer off. \n\nLonger internship will give you more experience as opposed to a shorter term, but you are locking into a very entry level role for a bit longer. If you're in college, or are on the fence about the role/job, I don't see a downside to the length.",

        "submission": "About 6 years ago, I started working for a company that asked me to open a satellite branch. I dont want to get into specifics, but we sell, install, and service products for homes and small businesses. The main company focuses on a separate type of industry than what I do, so they pretty much just let me run things. Corporate runs the accounting, and some purchasing. My team and I do basicly everything else.\n\nIn the beginning It was me, a laptop, and a vehicle. Over that time, we have grown it into a fairly profitable venture, with 7 employees (including myself). \nRecently, some changes happened within corporate, and I brought up the conversation about me possibly purchasing the company. They seemed open to the idea and asked me to come to them with an offer. This is where I need some advice. I need to know how to value the company and get an idea of what might be a reasonable price. \n\nSome specifics on the terms would be.\n\n1) I would not want the name or branding (my name is what most of my clients know anyway, and it's also tied to other industries in my area, so it would be easier to just rebrand)\n2) There are 3 full-size vans, 1 smaller van, and 1 sales vehicle, all in average condition. \n3) No brick and mortar would be involved. I'm sure I could lease the space we are in now for a short time till I can find another place. \n4) There is a book of business, and it has value, but there is no guaranteed RMR or contract value. Just happy customers and a good reputation that I built.\n\nMoney wise, the branch has brought in 1.7M this fiscal year, and we run at around 40% gross margin (goal is closer to 35%). Net YTD is 340K.\n\nEach year, I have been in the black and have grown gross profits 250K average each year. However, I feel that we have hit a plateau and will see much slower growth moving forward without substantial investment.\n\nWhen I brought up the conversation, they mentioned that most companies when they go to sell ask for net profit times 5. So that would be close to 1.25M. This seems way too high a number, IMO.\n\nHere's the real problem... my branch is a cash cow. We take up almost no corporate resources, and it's easy money for them. To top it off, the more profitable I make it, the more it will cost me when/if the time comes. \n\nI do think that they really don't want to be in my type of business anymore. They focus on other areas, and I get the feeling they would be glad to see us part ways if the price was right. \n\nI'm sure that they will take my \"sweat equity\" into account, but I just have no idea what that would be. \n\nAnother option I have is to leave the company (basicly tank them) and start my own. I strongly believe that all my employees would come with me, and customers would for sure as well. I have a non competition agreement with them, but it might cost me less to take the lawsuit than purchasing the company, but this goes against my moral compass. \n\nI have access to some of the money, but I already have a private investor that would be able to cover any remaining amount for a fee.\n\nWhat's your thoughts?",

Right now I do about 20K/mo. revenue with this division, lets call it \"Division Z.\"\n\nI think I could scale to a million+ a year in revenue with a team of team of 5-10. Right now I manage 2 workers with Division Z. I have 1 other division of the business right now and I would like to spearhead and open more to scale. Build an empire!\n\nRight now I do all of the critical work and I am that glue that holds Division Z. I could still hire but compartmentalize every task independently to keep workers in the dark of how it all comes together, keeping me as the glue and taking a decent amount of my time.\n\nBut what would be nice would be to hire a PM (project manager) from the Balkans (Serbia, Croatia) for around $2,500-3,500/mo. USD to do the hiring, team QA, firing, analytics/metrics, team meetings, operations, troubleshooting etc.\n\nA PM would be very nice. But there is not a very big barrier to entry for Division Z. For $500+ a month they could start doing it themselves on the side and build up.\n\nUsually when you tell someone of a great way to make money they rarely do it. I have done this where I show someone exactly how to make easy money and they just don't do it. But with this, I am employing them fulltime and they will learn everything.\n\nDivision Z is not a huge ocean, it is not like a client agency business where if the employee copies your SOP's and operations and goes and gets their own clients (or steals yours) it doesn't matter because there are a zillion clients in the world to go sell to. Another competitor would matter with Division Z.\n\n**Option A** \\- compartmentalize every task independently, keep workers tasks separate so no one understands the whole picture. Less risk, more time for me manage\n\n**Option B** \\- hire project manager, tell them how everything works. Takes this mostly off my plate but possible risk of them doing it for themselves. More time to scale the business and take my self out of the day to day of Division Z.",

I know I’m young, but I have a lot of time and strength to get out of my comfort zone to focus on my future self. But the problem is I can’t think of 1 thing to do with $1000. Any tips, books, people, and sites I should look up?",
        "comment": "Oh, to be 16.\n\n1. I had no idea how much free-time I had when I was single until I was married and had kids. Don't have kids, until you're absolutely ready to have no time to yourself.\n2. See #1. You have so much time available every day. Allocate that time to educating yourself on how to make money.\n3. Don't join an MLM.\n4. Don't pay money to an online guru to teach you how to make money. (They'll give you info for free if you listen to there free stuff, see below).\n5. I don't have experience with real estate but it is definitely a route you can go down. That path involves getting a real estate license. Since you're not an adult you can learn as much as possible about selling houses from books, the internet, online courses, the library, etc. Then start using all that damn free time to do it.\n6. If you don't want to go down that path, figure out another one that excites you and has a decent pay out.\n\nMan, if I were 16 again I'd quit playing video games and go on Udemy and find courses on internet marketing, software programming, data science, Unity, and whatever else interested me.\n\n7. There's a market for non-fiction audio books that is relatively untapped. The steps in the process are:\n\na. Choose a topic\n\nb. Get a ghost writer to write the book 25-30K word = 3 hour long audio book.Theurbanwriters.comGet a VO specialist to narrate the book [ACX.com](https://ACX.com), filter by audible approved. Fixed rate for 3 hours\n\nc. List it on Amazon\n\nd. Use profits to do it again\n\ne. Sell it as a print on demand book using ingramSpark\n\nf. List it on Author's Republic\n\ng. List your book on publishdrive\n\nh. Make more books and bundle the books you make and sell them as a digital bundle\n\ni. Relist the bundles on those sites above.-These steps are from [https://zuubly.com/audiobook/](https://zuubly.com/audiobook/) (I'm not affiliated with them I just learned about this from a youtube ad and I took notes)\n\n8. Read books like The Slight Edge, Atomic Habits, The Happiness Hypothesis, and others to make the most of your time and to be happy.\n\n9. $1000 in Wealthfront will earn 4.05% annually (there are other online banks that earn slightly more, it's just an example).\n\n10. Use the money to educate yourself and learn valuable things.  Make progress consistently, over a long period of time. Don't give up on your dreams.\n\n11. Stay out of debt. Debt is awful. I've been in debt for almost 20 years and am just getting out now. What you don't learn about credit cards and loans until you use them is they're robbing you of the only thing you have an abundance of, time. Your time ends up being worth less the deeper in debt you are. Eventually ALL your time is spent paying off debt, or worse remaining in debt indefinitely. Until you finally earn more income per hour and you can pay it all off (that's what I finally did) you're just stuck under a mountain, being a slave to credit card and loan companies. Don't do it if you can avoid it.",

You have your own rate (price on one usdt) and it is usually higher than the market price which makes it profitable. People who cant buy it inside an exchange or whatever can then buy from another person with their own bank or app (like cashapp, paypal etc) directly.   \n\n\nAnyways, the guy explained how he did and everything and after a lot of research and trial I finally found my own way in this odd business and Im pretty much the only guy doing this in some certain countries (2 countries that I have directed to where I sell USDT to those people). This year it has went very well for me, around 3500$ in profit since the start of 2023.   \n\n\nThe only problem now is that I want to scale and start a company for this because I see potential, but I don't know how.

Looking for honest opinions and not the usual “restaurant will drain you”, if theres money to be made, then I am there.  I have a degree in business &amp; finance and a passion for food so I will do whatever to be successful, strictly looking for opinions and thoughts on the concept/idea so here it goes:\n\nA restaurant with the korean bbq setup except its all latino foods. \n\nI’ve been thinking about how those restaurants easily up-charge you just on the fact that its ‘all you can eat’ but in reality their margins are still decent with cheap meat in bulk, hardly any need for any type of gourmet chefs since its just waiters taking meat from the fridge to the table, good experience for drinking, etc. \nAnd think about it, with most places charging 35$ a head, thats a hell of a dish to sell at any other decent restaurant. \nBut what really had me thinking is why do we associate korean bbq with the whole self cooking meats restaurant experience?  Who said only korean bbq is like that and who said that is even korean bbq?  90% of the meats at those places do not come marinated making them basically just a neutral cut of meat. Yes the sides are definitely korean but other than that, doesn’t every culture grill their meats socially?\n\nSo thats why I think a latino version would be a hit. \n\nYou could offer a wide range of beef for carne asada styles, chicken, pork such as carnitas, etc all either marinated or not (up price for marinated of course). And sides could include corn, different styles of beans and rice, salsas, chips, quesos, tortillas, etc\n\nWith an emphasis on selling alcohol drinks as well of course, I dont see why it would be hard to keep a good margin especially since latin food can be very cheap to produce. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or any reason you think this would not work.

        "submission": "When I was 24, almost 25 (early 2018) I started my first business. Importing one of a kind furniture and decorations from Asia. I had about 10k saved up, booked a one way flight and travled around for 7 weeks to source products and suppliers. I had the most amazing time of my life, it felt so good. I was out from early in the morning till late at night, so exited and in the zone I even forgot to eat.\n\nI stayed untill the container was loaded. When I returned home I did not have any money left to rent storage space, so I had to sell some things before they arrived, which i did through a Facebook page i started before I left. That gave me enough money to pay the first month of rent.\n\nThe first space was a small garage near my home, large enough to fit a 20ft container and space around it to showcase. From there on I supplied a shop in shop somewhere else. A couple months later I managed to het 3x the space for half the price, so I moved. I wanted to hold my first real store here, but marketing still lacked and the location was in an industrial area. Also my stock was limited, a couple months later again I cycled past a building on a good shopping street here in town that had been empty for a while. It wasn't for rent, but I managed to buy the ownership details online and got in touch. There it was, my first real store about 7 months after I went off to Asia.\n\nThe building was much larger and my stock was lacking, I wanted to go back and get more stock, but I wanted to get a full 40ft container, so I lended the missing 5000 and got back on a plane. When I arrived back and the items were on the way I got the key, I had about 3 weeks to fix up the store beofre the new container arrived. We finished just in time. That month was the best sales month in the first year! I was finally in business for real!\n\nI would spend over 60 hours a week building my business and it never ever felt like work. I would save untill I had about 22k (enough for a full container) and  immediately travel back to Asia for another buying trip, wich I enjoyed the most.\n\nHowever, things didnt come easy. I did everything myself, and the town that I was in was not exactly the place you'd find my target audience. Six months later I got a chance to rent a hugee (500m2) store near prime location in a really good and touristy city. Extremeley cheap, utitlities included. However, it was a 2 week lease. Meaning every 2 weeks they could end the contract. I had to think about that offcourse, but decided to take the risk. It turned out to be the best decision.\n\nI ended up staying there for 3 years and business was booming. In 2020 I turned €80k profit. 2021 was a little bit less but still good.\n\nI basicly started this business for the buying trips to Asia and to source wonderfull unique products, not to be in a store all the time, wich offcourse is a large part of the business. When corona hit offcourse I could not make those trips, wich was fine for the first year or so. From mid 2021 on i noticed I started to slowly lose may passion for the business.\n\nAt the end of 2021 I hear I got to leave the building and have 2 weeks to find something else. I had a backup, but it's in the location I came from thats really not so good. It felt like a huge step back at a time that business was already really down.\n\nThen one week after the move my girlfriend of 3+ years decided to break up. Another week later we enter the most stict lockdown of all time, that includes closing my store. I was at the lowest I had felt in over a decade, maybe the lowest I had felt all my life. Serious depression hit. I felt like I lost everything that really mattered to me.\n\nAlltho personally I'm really doing much much better, even good at times, I never really got the exitement, passion, or even hope for my business back. For the past year I've just been opening my store passivly and not puting in any work. Sales are pretty much non excistant anymore, I lost so much hope that some days when its really cold i dont even open the store anymore (there is no heating, it's too large/expensive to heat anyway and I'm freezing there) and I just know no one is coming in anyway.\n\nI know there is still alot of potential in the products, its just that doing unique items is so labour intensive, and I just can't get myself to do the work, I don't see the point. I don't really know what to do.\n\nAt the beginning it made me feel so free, I didnt even care when I did not earn so much yet, cause I felt like I was building my dream. Now I just feel imprissoned and stuck with my business, I also feel incapable and worthless for neglecting something I'd spend so much time building. I just feel in inadequate to even continue.\n\nHas anyone been in a situation like this?\n\nI still have stock, there is even a new container on it's way. I just get overwhelmed by the amount of work I have to to trying to sell it, since evey item is unique the is so labout intensive for a webshop, and I can't do marketing on product level cause it's just not worth it being able to sell only once.",
