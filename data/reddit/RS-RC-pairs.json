I saw that it was listed for sale and that the lease is up at the beginning of June. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot ask the owner about the circumstances. Is it normal to have a business listed for sale but still possibly planning on keeping it? Should I expect that the business could go under when the lease is up? Or can you sell a business in the middle of a lease? \n\nI guess I am wondering if I will be out of a job, or if we will get a new owner or if she is actually just keeping it but seeing if anyone wants to give her a lot of money.\n\nThanks!\n\nDefinitely not in a place to ask around work - but was considering making a burner email to message the agent on the listing. would they usually give me any information over email or would they want to make an official appointment or call? \nThe business name is not listed on the listing but everything else about it is so I have no doubt about it, but obviously they are trying to keep it slightly secretive.",

Earn sponsorship money. Earn royalties per platform. Perform at a concert? \n\nForget it, just design a mobile app or create a social media website. Then you could earn millions per year. \n\nOr if you can't do any of that, figure out your skill and start selling ebooks and online courses in your niche. \n\nTry crowdfunding on Kickstarter for a drone delivery service. \n\nTry crowdfunding to produce a video game... \n\nLet's make a business completely run by ai, software,   integrations, automations, partnerships, volunteers, and bots so you can manage remotely from your smartphone.

        "comment": "I'm a commercial lender, have worked on transactions like this. Who you need is somewhat a function of your background and experience, but at minimum you would want the following parties involved:\n\n1. Business attorney who is familiar with business purchases. They will help you draft an LOI, purchase agreement, perform legal due diligence \n2. Lender. This is who will assist you with financing the acquisition, assuming you are not paying all cash. They will work with you on how to properly structure the debt, which may include multiple types of loans (real estate loan if applicable, acquisition loan for the business assets, working capital LOC, if applicable, plus bank services like deposit accounts)\n3. Accountant. If you are already skilled with finance and accounting, this may not be necessary, but still not bad to have one to assist even if you are a finance guy. They can help with financial due diligence to ensure the seller of the business is being truthful in what they provide you, and may also help with financial forecasts to ensure the business can support the debt. They may also perform business appraisals to ensure you are not over paying. It will be almost impossible to make money if you over pay\n4. Sometimes a business broker is involved. Like a real estate agent they assist with negotiating price and terms. But, this isn't absolutely necessary and much of what they do can be done by an attorney who you absolutely should have regardless. \n5. Other industry specific resources may be needed, but in my mind the above are the most critical regardless of industry and business",

A high end corporate sales job, but in an industry that was at the time (during a recession) generally getting offloaded to Japan/UK.    I spent some months looking for a job in my field.  About 3 months in I got a dream offer.  A move to another large city but working directly for the Sr V.P. of a large international construction company.  He called on Wed to offer me the job and promised to follow up immediately with a written offer letter.   On Saturday I received the offer letter.   On Monday morning first thing I called him.  His asst answered and told me she would transfer me.  Unfortunately she transferred me to the head of HR that informed me that my new boss had been laid off that morning and they were going to have to rescind the offer letter.   At that moment I came to the realization that you have.   I decided no more corporate jobs.   I contacted Merrill Lynch, Coldwell Banker and Prudential.   At the time (1985) the biggest and best in Financial Services, Real Estate and Insurance.   I interviewed them all and picked Prudential, primarily as I was an active golfer and didn't want the weekend work of RE and the stock brokers of that era were all commission based and your gig went to zero every Jan 1.   Insurance  on the other hand paid you half of your commissions up front and than 9 more years of 10% of the gross commissions as 'renewals.'     Today the Financial folks work on % of assets under management so they do have recurring revenue and the insurance folks don't get renewals although their commissions are more front loaded to make up for it.   Today I likely would have gone with ML.    In any commissioned job it takes a bit of time and effort to get going, but I was able to make at least 90% of my previous salary the first 3 years and the 4th I made double my old salary and never looked back.\n\nThink about it.  For every 100 grand a corporation pays you likely you are earning them 200 grand or more.   Why not capture a bit more of that gross for yourself plus earn a whole lot of autonomy.   If you have 200 clients, one or two may fire you, but that doesn't put  you out of work.   \n\nGood luck to you.",

I'm sure I could lease the space we are in now for a short time till I can find another place. \n4) There is a book of business, and it has value, but there is no guaranteed RMR or contract value.

However, I feel that we have hit a plateau and will see much slower growth moving forward without substantial investment.\n\nWhen I brought up the conversation, they mentioned that most companies when they go to sell ask for net profit times 5. So that would be close to 1.25M. This seems way too high a number, IMO.\n\nHere's the real problem... my branch is a cash cow. We take up almost no corporate resources, and it's easy money for them. To top it off, the more profitable I make it, the more it will cost me when/if the time comes. \n\nI do think that they really don't want to be in my type of business anymore. They focus on other areas, and I get the feeling they would be glad to see us part ways if the price was right. \n\nI'm sure that they will take my \"sweat equity\" into account, but I just have no idea what that would be. \n\nAnother option I have is to leave the company (basicly tank them) and start my own. I strongly believe that all my employees would come with me, and customers would for sure as well. I have a non competition agreement with them, but it might cost me less to take the lawsuit than purchasing the company, but this goes against my moral compass. \n\nI have access to some of the money, but I already have a private investor that would be able to cover any remaining amount for a fee.\n\nWhat's your thoughts?",

Last year I was very hands-on with this division, I spent 35K and revenue was 165K (130K profit). Right now I do about 20K/mo. revenue with this division, lets call it \"Division Z.\"\n\nI think I could scale to a million+ a year in revenue with a team of team of 5-10. Right now I manage 2 workers with Division Z. I have 1 other division of the business right now and I would like to spearhead and open more to scale. Build an empire!\n\nRight now I do all of the critical work and I am that glue that holds Division Z. I could still hire but compartmentalize every task independently to keep workers in the dark of how it all comes together, keeping me as the glue and taking a decent amount of my time.\n\nBut what would be nice would be to hire a PM (project manager) from the Balkans (Serbia, Croatia) for around $2,500-3,500/mo. USD to do the hiring, team QA, firing, analytics/metrics, team meetings, operations, troubleshooting etc.\n\nA PM would be very nice. But there is not a very big barrier to entry for Division Z. For $500+ a month they could start doing it themselves on the side and build up.\n\nUsually when you tell someone of a great way to make money they rarely do it. I have done this where I show someone exactly how to make easy money and they just don't do it. But with this, I am employing them fulltime and they will learn everything.\n\nDivision Z is not a huge ocean, it is not like a client agency business where if the employee copies your SOP's and operations and goes and gets their own clients (or steals yours) it doesn't matter because there are a zillion clients in the world to go sell to. Another competitor would matter with Division Z.\n\n**Option A** \\- compartmentalize every task independently, keep workers tasks separate so no one understands the whole picture. Less risk, more time for me manage\n\n**Option B** \\- hire project manager, tell them how everything works. Takes this mostly off my plate but possible risk of them doing it for themselves.

Don't join an MLM.\n4. Don't pay money to an online guru to teach you how to make money. (They'll give you info for free if you listen to there free stuff, see below).\n5. I don't have experience with real estate but it is definitely a route you can go down. That path involves getting a real estate license. Since you're not an adult you can learn as much as possible about selling houses from books, the internet, online courses, the library, etc. Then start using all that damn free time to do it.\n6. If you don't want to go down that path, figure out another one that excites you and has a decent pay out.\n\nMan, if I were 16 again I'd quit playing video games and go on Udemy and find courses on internet marketing, software programming, data science, Unity, and whatever else interested me.\n\n7.

I have a degree in business &amp; finance and a passion for food so I will do whatever to be successful, strictly looking for opinions and thoughts on the concept/idea so here it goes:\n\nA restaurant with the korean bbq setup except its all latino foods. \n\nI’ve been thinking about how those restaurants easily up-charge you just on the fact that its ‘all you can eat’ but in reality their margins are still decent with cheap meat in bulk, hardly any need for any type of gourmet chefs since its just waiters taking meat from the fridge to the table, good experience for drinking, etc. \nAnd think about it, with most places charging 35$ a head, thats a hell of a dish to sell at any other decent restaurant. \nBut what really had me thinking is why do we associate korean bbq with the whole self cooking meats restaurant experience?  Who said only korean bbq is like that and who said that is even korean bbq?  90% of the meats at those places do not come marinated making them basically just a neutral cut of meat. Yes the sides are definitely korean but other than that, doesn’t every culture grill their meats socially?\n\nSo thats why I think a latino version would be a hit. \n\nYou could offer a wide range of beef for carne asada styles, chicken, pork such as carnitas, etc all either marinated or not (up price for marinated of course). And sides could include corn, different styles of beans and rice, salsas, chips, quesos, tortillas, etc\n\nWith an emphasis on selling alcohol drinks as well of course, I dont see why it would be hard to keep a good margin especially since latin food can be very cheap to produce. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts or any reason you think this would not work.

I had about 10k saved up, booked a one way flight and travled around for 7 weeks to source products and suppliers. I had the most amazing time of my life, it felt so good. I was out from early in the morning till late at night, so exited and in the zone I even forgot to eat.\n\nI stayed untill the container was loaded. When I returned home I did not have any money left to rent storage space, so I had to sell some things before they arrived, which i did through a Facebook page i started before I left. That gave me enough money to pay the first month of rent.\n\nThe first space was a small garage near my home, large enough to fit a 20ft container and space around it to showcase. From there on I supplied a shop in shop somewhere else. A couple months later I managed to het 3x the space for half the price, so I moved. I wanted to hold my first real store here, but marketing still lacked and the location was in an industrial area. Also my stock was limited, a couple months later again I cycled past a building on a good shopping street here in town that had been empty for a while. It wasn't for rent, but I managed to buy the ownership details online and got in touch. There it was, my first real store about 7 months after I went off to Asia.\n\nThe building was much larger and my stock was lacking, I wanted to go back and get more stock, but I wanted to get a full 40ft container, so I lended the missing 5000 and got back on a plane. When I arrived back and the items were on the way I got the key, I had about 3 weeks to fix up the store beofre the new container arrived. We finished just in time. That month was the best sales month in the first year! I was finally in business for real!\n\nI would spend over 60 hours a week building my business and it never ever felt like work. I would save untill I had about 22k (enough for a full container) and  immediately travel back to Asia for another buying trip, wich I enjoyed the most.\n\nHowever, things didnt come easy. I did everything myself, and the town that I was in was not exactly the place you'd find my target audience. Six months later I got a chance to rent a hugee (500m2) store near prime location in a really good and touristy city. Extremeley cheap, utitlities included. However, it was a 2 week lease. Meaning every 2 weeks they could end the contract. I had to think about that offcourse, but decided to take the risk. It turned out to be the best decision.\n\nI ended up staying there for 3 years and business was booming. In 2020 I turned €80k profit. 2021 was a little bit less but still good.\n\nI basicly started this business for the buying trips to Asia and to source wonderfull unique products, not to be in a store all the time, wich offcourse is a large part of the business. When corona hit offcourse I could not make those trips, wich was fine for the first year or so. From mid 2021 on i noticed I started to slowly lose may passion for the business.\n\nAt the end of 2021 I hear I got to leave the building and have 2 weeks to find something else. I had a backup, but it's in the location I came from thats really not so good. It felt like a huge step back at a time that business was already really down.\n\nThen one week after the move my girlfriend of 3+ years decided to break up. Another week later we enter the most stict lockdown of all time, that includes closing my store. I was at the lowest I had felt in over a decade, maybe the lowest I had felt all my life. Serious depression hit. I felt like I lost everything that really mattered to me.\n\nAlltho personally I'm really doing much much better, even good at times, I never really got the exitement, passion, or even hope for my business back. For the past year I've just been opening my store passivly and not puting in any work. Sales are pretty much non excistant anymore, I lost so much hope that some days when its really cold i dont even open the store anymore (there is no heating, it's too large/expensive to heat anyway and I'm freezing there) and I just know no one is coming in anyway.\n\nI know there is still alot of potential in the products, its just that doing unique items is so labour intensive, and I just can't get myself to do the work, I don't see the point. I don't really know what to do.\n\nAt the beginning it made me feel so free, I didnt even care when I did not earn so much yet, cause I felt like I was building my dream. Now I just feel imprissoned and stuck with my business, I also feel incapable and worthless for neglecting something I'd spend so much time building. I just feel in inadequate to even continue.\n\nHas anyone been in a situation like this?\n\nI still have stock, there is even a new container on it's way. I just get overwhelmed by the amount of work I have to to trying to sell it, since evey item is unique the is so labout intensive for a webshop, and I can't do marketing on product level cause it's just not worth it being able to sell only once.",

I think everyone's been there when you lack passion, the drive, and feel it's pointless. I think it would help if you got yourself back into it, just opening up the store... think of new ways to get people into your store and talking to potential customers (even one customer) will bring back good feelings. Post a sign that says, free hot tea or coffee (my friend offered free hot chocolate to kids for a children's furniture store), create a promotion with a purchase (free throw blanket and market it as \"free WARM throw blanket with purchase of x amount\").

Beware, extended response. \n\nCliche but actual life perspective: \n\nYou only have one life to live, and you’re in a sliver of time called the present; you have an opportunity. \n\nBe where you’re feet are, take in the moment (a.k.a- breathe in the moment) \n\nImage Motivation: \n\nStop seeking perfection. Stop worrying about what other people think. All people fail, and it’s how people navigate failure that is the true characterization of person. Override negative thoughts with positive outcomes. Not ignoring negatives because they teach you something, but always ending on a positive note in word, deed, and stature. \n\nWhat do you think you are currently characterized by?\n\nFor me, I’m a procrastinator, inconsistent, selfish, and often a quitter. Awesome, now I know what to shoot for and for me I’m shooting to change my characterizations in the exact opposite direction of those things every single day. “Atomic habits”  the book has some good references about this but this adage of really evaluating what you want to be characterized by every day. \n\nIf I may, based on your post I see someone who is a perfectionist, creative, good starter - poor finisher, etc.. \n\nYou have an opportunity to change some habits that will pay off later. \n\nWhen it comes to business ideas, act like a true business man or women and evaluate the market using google trends, semrush, and determine the markets you are interested in that are making money. Then see what people are selling in those markets by keying in keywords to google trends, semrush, etc. Once you get into it, you can see what people are googling in your town at certain points in the year.  I’m in D.C., and I know that people are googling mid-priced jackets and shopping this time of year because of the cold. It’s just interesting to see what people need. Great businesses that last are based upon needs and needs change with technology. I would almost say “convenience” instead of need in the U.S.\n\nYou’ll be surprised how many market needs you can find. It’s too often people get stuck on a single business idea when they should have 5 business ideas they are evaluating simultaneously. The whole eggs in different basket idea. You don’t want to get too emotionally invested into an idea, which according to your post, you already have this going for you naturally ;) but you could use some work on the finishing side and drawing a final conclusion about an idea. Because some ideas just suck, but you needed to see them through so you don’t regret it.\n\nI’m a firm believer in the new phrase floating around, the more you f*** around the more you actually find out the truth about business ideas and if they will work. \n\nAh, I needed this advice today.

As of 2023 we have been around for 10 years and we did about $900k pre-Covid but after everything was said and done and I was paid out, we would be running at a small loss.  Covid happened and we pivoted to focus on our most profitable revenue stream.  After a few years we are leaner and profitable but our revenues are much lower (approx $500k).  Gross margins before covid were about 33% and now are about 65%. 2021 was a rebuilding year and we had only about $250k in revenue but margins were still better than 2019.  \n\nWe see great room for growth but I am tired and would like to move on to focus on another business that I am more passionate about.

        "comment": "I was a franchisor of a B2C service, so I have some unique insight into franchising as a business model. Here is a quick and dirty overview:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Your franchise fee gets you immediate access to systems (operations, hiring/training, website, marketing) and full training, so you can hit the ground running and not figure stuff out on your own. \n2. You have a team committed to your success (area manager, head office team, etc)\n3. You join a peer network to collaborate and support you (other franchisees)\n4. There are opportunities to grow by expanding to multiple locations\n5. If the revenue is there, you can hire a manager to do all the daily working in the business, freeing you up to develop other businesses or do other things\n6. In theory, it's a low-risk move because the business model has been tried and tested. You are not starting something new, you are operating a duplicate of what has already been successful.\n\nCons:\n\n1. It's still high risk. Just because other franchisees have been successful does not mean that your own location will be. How many hours/sweat equity other franchisees put in may not be disclosed, and you may find yourself working harder than you expected\n2. Your investment is tied to many things outside of your control. Just think of the negative media hits major brands have taken when individual employees do dumb-ass things. Bad publicity and lost consumer trust can hit your revenue because of what someone else far away did. \n3. As a franchisee, you have zero control over your brand and operating structure. If they decide to add a new menu item/switch providers/increase the cost of stuff/change ANYTHING and you hate it, too bad. Like a good little soldier you have to follow along, or risk penalties for failing to adhere to the system.\n4. Like an employee, your performance and activities are monitored. You are held accountable, and if you fail to meet standards you can get fined or even lose your franchise. Or be denied renewal when your term comes up for renewal. Saying \"it's my business\" doesn't fly because it is the brand and system of the franchise you invested in.\n5. Your exit strategy is tied to demand for the brand you invested in, market conditions, etc. Check out franchise resales to see how many people are trying to get out of their business and can't find a buyer\n\nThink about what your goals are. Do you really want to run a business? Do you just want a return on the money? What is your risk tolerance? All of that will help guide you towards what you want to do.",

He runs a small business and was struggling to keep up with administrative tasks, such as answering emails and scheduling appointments. He decided to hire a couple of virtual assistants and has been extremely satisfied with the quality of their work and the amount of money he has saved.\n\nVirtual assistants are a great way to outsource administrative tasks without compromising on the quality of the work. They can handle a variety of tasks, including customer service, data entry, social media management, and more. Plus, they are often available 24/7, which is a huge advantage for businesses that operate across multiple time zones.\n\nMy friend's experience got me thinking about the benefits of virtual assistants and I wanted to hear your thoughts. Have you ever hired virtual assistants for your business? If so, what was your experience like? If not, what are your reservations about doing so?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you and starting a discussion about the pros and cons of hiring virtual assistants for businesses.

That way you can watch the prep going on and feel like it's all part of the process. And each shift has a grandmotherly like figure with an apron that serves the individuals their fresh meals and/or takes their orders?? That way they get an experience of the recipes and the environment are truly like a family. Like as if it was their own grandma's cooking. 'The Grandma Chef\" could even have their own mantra.\n\nWith aging baby Boomers, such a model could be good for retirees. They could even 'adopt' a local community and increase better respect for the elderly.\n\nThere could even be different themes to this too with relevant menu items like Old Western Style, German, Scottish, and etc...\n\nAny additional ideas to this would also be appreciated.",

Whatever you are selling has to have substantial impact to the small business, because smaller businesses cannot risk any losses. Especially startups that has only been around for 5 years.\n\nAlso small businesses do not like the robotic messaging from automated emails, they are more interested in tight partnership discussions that makes sense for their product or brand. They prefer to have chats with higher management or bosses if other businesses are serious about their SaaS proposition. \n\nUnless it's a common standard product stack, like Microsoft Office or the Atlassian stack for IT companies.",

Where and how did you get to fund the expenses?\n* What are your initial measures un getting clients?\n\nAppreciate your thoughts and insights. Thanks much!",
        "comment": "I haven't started a business, however I did experience a startup blooming over the course of 5 years and I was one of the first 5 employees of the business. Not sure if my experience is valid, but here goes.\n\nBased on the business model we started out, the startup I joined was a \"skills for hire\" business model. Oddly enough this was the quickest way to keep the lights on while still being able to do R&amp;D on the side.\n\nMy boss essentially did the \"try before you buy\" approach, he will let me shadow him for about a month as an intern, then if  the client is happy with the results he would come to an agreement and charge them hourly rates based on the work we would be doing.\n\nOf course since this is a service based industry, he has to take a cut of that hourly rate. The plus for me was that I could freely work for various clients and learn from every business, whether big or small as much as I wanted within a short period of time. As my skills rapidly grew, so did the rates and my personal income and I could also eventually train more interns by myself. This resulted into the company rapidly expanding and growing in terms of various skillsets.\n\nYou know the saying  \"It's the employees that make the company\".\n\nEventually the income and experience builds up to be substantial enough to build a really decent product. Since then you now have a feel for the market, you know the gaps, you have the skillsets and enough income to keep the lights on whilst still working on the product.\n\nDue to the nature of automation within the \"Quality Assurance\" industry eventually the company's skillsets branched out to DevOps and Cloud Engineering. And I don't mean the lame version of DevOps, since people seem to have this misconception that DevOps is about just writing scripts and maintaining infrastructure. The DevOps I'm talking about is related to Systems Engineering and overall optimization of company processes. Effectively coming up with solutions to optimise the Dev, Test and SysOps team processes or in more fancier terms: Optimising the entire SDLC process.\n\nThe products that came out from the various skill sets are: an advanced test framework, pre-built cloud infrastructure and software delivery patterns.\n\nThe company I'm working for is now in the process of splitting into a Quality Assurance company and a Systems Reliability Engineering Company.\n\nI used this entire experience to understand how to start and run a business, since I worked for so many clients I could also experience various pitfalls or challenges of small, medium and big companies. My plan is to now use the experience I have, focus on making enough money to back myself up and then start my own business with all the knowledge and experience I gained.\n\nFYI\n\nWhen working with investors there is unfortunately high expectations for rapid growth. If at all possible, try to avoid investors unless it's absolutely necessary. Investors tend to also fog up your vision and make you lose a bit of control over your company.\n\nWhen running a business the 2 best core advise I've seen that works are:\n\n* Networking.  Build up a strong customer/client base.\n* Healthy Employee Dynamics. You want to keep a healthy relationship with both your clients and employees.\n\nRemember that even if your product or service is the best, if no one is buying it then you are failing the business. Advertising attracts new customers, quality retains long term customers.\n\nThe service industry is hard work, difficult but pays immediately.\n\nThe product industry post-workload is easier, it takes time to build the product and you only start seeing monetary results later once the product is built.\n\nTo know whether your product is a great product there are 3 common criteria to meet. The product must have:\n\n* ease of deployment/setup\n* ease of use\n* ease of maintenance\n\nOf course there might be a 4th rule for physical products regarding waste, but sofar I could only give you info on intangible IT related products so yeah...

        "submission": " \n\nThis spawned out of another discussion on how High school students can develop an entrepreneurial skill stack. The intent of this is to provide a framework of resources for 18 years old who want to operate a trade business in 4 years. I know I have some blind spots and I would love your feedback on how to improve this.\n\nI’ve spent over a decade in the trades; most of my experience is from working up the enlisted ranks in the Air Force. When I left active duty I was looking at buying different shops in my industry, so I could operate them as a business owner. I went from not knowing anything about a trade to running sections of 13 tradesmen. I read 30 to 50 books per year. So a lot of this is me condensing that into the things that gave me the most value on my journey. I am obviously limited by my perspective, that’s why I need your help to make this resource more valuable.\n\nYes, “just in time learning” is incredibly powerful. However, there are different personality types that need a top down framework.\n\nTo the 18 year old who wants to run a plumbing company in 4 years,\n\nSo there are two paths, which are very similar to the military’s officer vs enlisted dichotomy. There is the professional manager/business operator which mirrors the officer path. Then there is the subject matter expert(SME) or trades men role, which mirrors the enlisted path. There are advantageous and disadvantageous to both of them.\n\nWhat are some of the biggest problems that a trade business will run into?\n\n* Issues with personnel\n* Training new people\n* Keeping required licenses/certifications\n* Sales\n* Operations\n* Logistics\n* Finances\n\nSo what are the advantageous/disadvantageous of each role, and how do they prepare you to tackle these issues?\n\n* Tradesmen (enlisted)  \n\n   * Pros  \n\n      * Deep subject matter expert in that field\n      * This will allow you to know BS when you smell it\n      * Your future employees will know BS, when they smell it. Being a SME keeps you grounded.\n      * There is a steep learning curve for your first trade, but its way less for your second, third, etc.\n   * You will be able to understand how tradesmen work/think\n   * You can treat your time as an apprentice as a “paid internship.”\n   * You can get the licenses the business needs under your name. i.e. some jurisdictions require a master plumber for a plumbing company. If that’s you, you don’t need to worry about losing a key employee which shuts down the business.\n   * Cons  \n\n      * If you don’t have a plan it can be “pigeon holing”\n      * Its hard on the body long term, 10 – 12 hrs. of hard labor 5-6 days a week. It's easy when your 20, much harder when you 45.\n* Professional manager (officer)  \n\n   * Pros  \n\n      * Manage operations across industries\n      * Mange logistics across different business\n      * More in-depth understanding of how to raise capital and manage finances.\n      * Better business strategic management\n   * Cons  \n\n      * Usually, more debt for higher education\n      * It can become too far removed from the “field” to know what matters on a tactical level\n\nThere is a way to maximize the benefits of both while negating the cons. This third path is were an enlisted (tradesmen) will cross over to officer (professional manager). However this has a long time horizon or a higher workload, depending on how you chunk things.\n\nSo what can that look like?\n\nIf you’re going for a four-year degree, make sure its business focused or aligned to the trades. Some examples; construction management, architecture, project management, business analyses, etc. While you’re going to school work in as many trades as possible. Think 3-6 months as an HVAC installer, 3 months as a “sparky” over summer break, work weekends as a landscaper during the spring, etc.\n\nThis will give you:\n\n* A wide range of trade experience\n* The ability to see how multiple business operate\n* Away to reduce the amount of debt for higher education\n\nOr\n\nIf you know what trade you want to go into, spend four years working as an apprentice to become a licensed journeymen. While you’re doing this create your own business school. You’ll have a lot of time going back and forth to job sites that you can redeem with audiobooks. Help out with the business operations side and learn sales.\n\nThis will give you:\n\n* A journeymen level trade\n* A debt free education\n* A sizeable nest egg, depending on how much you save\n* Enough experience to either open your own shop or buy one\n\nIf you want to create your own personalized business school, do the following:\n\nLearn to lead different types of teams through a multitude of environments. If you don’t have a way to do this professionally, volunteer with your student organizations, local church, or other organization you’re passionate about.\n\nMaster your personnel finances. If you can’t control a $500 paycheck, how can you expect to control a $50,000 paycheck?\n\nHere is tier list of books to replace a traditional BA in business. The average CEO of a fortunate 500 company reads 50 books per year. You can do at least 25 books. This frame work can get you that education within 25 books, 18 core books with 7 for electives. So 25 weeks or 1 year will save you 4 years fulltime. Also supplement this with free training from SBA.

In these situations I would suggest just accepting it. That is how things are some times. Shareholdings don't work like meritocratic employment hierarchies. Sometimes they are unfair. But as long as everyone is putting the effort in then that should be seen as a positive.\n\nThe bigger issue is when people aren't putting equal effort in, inevitably a harder issue to solve.

        "submission": "Hi!\n\nOur candidate backed out after some personal issues, so we need to hire again (still?).  Our last round of applicants/candidates was not great.  For background, all applicants for our position will be coming from out of state due to the niche nature of this position and no relevant other companies or programs in the state.\n\nOur options going forward are:\n\n1. Repost immediately.  It would likely take a month optimistically to lock in a candidate (after interviews). By this time odds of them finding housing in our highly seasonal town will be very minimal (currently there are already minimal options for the summer).  This may present a challenge to the candidate accepting the job, being able to move here, etc. (its common for applicants to back out due to not finding housing).\n2. Be short-staffed for the summer through an incredibly challenging season and repost closer to fall, when housing options will become more abundant (and our ability to attract applicants will be more likely).\n3. Do nothing and wait to find out if we will have temp employee housing (may find out in the next week or 2).  Doing nothing guarantees the housing market gets worse, but allows me to see if I can pursue hiring a temp.  There is no guarantee on the housing or me finding a temp, however, but this would allow me to repost later for a better housing environment.  \n\nEdit: My department does not have authority to do any type of provided housing for staff.  This is also not something the company does unfortunately so I do not have authority to change this.  Temp housing that I reference is rented as-possible from the local college dorm and is shared and highly restrictive, which is not an option allowed for full-time staff, and is only available June-August.",
        "comment": "Depending on the value of the position, I would look into buying a 6 month lease  right now. Then you could offer, as part of the onboarding process, the balance of the 6 month lease to allow the new hire to find permanent housing after the high season. You could either pay for the rental housing, offer them a reduced rent until relocation is complete, or offer it at the rate you are paying.

Here are some factors to consider:\n\nA clear and viable business idea: Before starting a business, you should have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve and how you plan to do it. Conduct market research to identify a need that you can fill, and ensure that your product or service is something that people are willing to pay for.\n\nPassion and commitment: Starting a business can be a long and challenging journey, and it takes a lot of passion and commitment to see it through. You need to be willing to work hard and make sacrifices to make your business a success.\n\nFinancial resources: Starting a business requires an initial investment, and you need to have the financial resources to cover your startup costs and sustain your business until it becomes profitable. You should also have a financial plan in place to ensure that you can manage your cash flow and meet your financial obligations.\n\nSkills and expertise: You need to have the skills and expertise required to run a successful business. This includes skills in marketing, sales, finance, and management, as well as expertise in your industry or niche.\n\nMarket demand: Your business needs to meet a market demand and be able to compete with other businesses in your industry. This requires a deep understanding of your target market and the competitive landscape.\n\nIf you have these factors in place, starting a business can be worth it. However, it's important to remember that starting a business involves risks, and there is no guarantee of success. You should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the risks before deciding to start a business.\"",

I had a company come out that serviced the previous owner.  The guy who came out was familiar with the property and wrote up an estimate that was as such:  \n\n\n(2020)\n\n1800 for spring clean up   \n1440 for biweekly mowing  \n320 for bed weeding  \n\n\nThe following year (2021) the prices went up around $350.  No big deal.  \n\n\n2022 The price shot up $700 and was itemized as such...  \n\n\n3686 for spring clean up  \n39 for miss utility  \n480 for brown mulch upgrade (we'd always had this but it was never charged extra)   \n99 for mowing\\*\\*  \n\n\nAt the time I renewed the 2022 contract I didn't pay as much attention as I should have.  I didn't notice that they put 99 for mowing instead of the bulk price as it had been before and noted that it would be 99 biweekly for every mow.  I am sure I had a lot going on (mom with 2 kids) and just didn't go over it carefully or I would have noticed the price of spring clean up had doubled.  \n\n\n2023 I get my contract which shows   \n\n\n3815 spring clean up  \n99 for mowing  \n39 miss utility  \n414 bed weeding  \n496 brown mulch upgrade  \n\n\nI was about to make the same mistake I did in 2022 except this time I asked them to amend the contract to include the $100 coupon I had.  \n\n\nIn the contract they resent it showed the coupon but they changed the mow amount from the 99 to the full amount for the entire contract which came out to $1645.  That brought the total price to $6410 which made me go...hey...and compared that to the original 2020 contract which was priced at $3260 for everything.  \n\n\nI called and told them I had questions about how the price has jumped so high since 2020.  The woman said \"Mr (name of company) handles that account.  I will have him reach out.  That was last Thursday and he called today.    \n\n\nHis explanation was that his workers told him that they had grossly underpriced the job when we got our estimate and that it was taking his guys 2.5 days (this part is true) to complete the job.  He said that he also had a note that he had called and explained the doubling of the clean up price to me last year, which 100% did not happen.  I also was never consulted about the uncharge for brown mulch.  He told me that even with this doubling of price he was still barely clearing any profit...$200 max.  I mentioned the previous owner and he looked them up and confirmed they were also paying around 1800 for spring cleanup.  I asked him how it was possible that a representative of the company gave an estimate to 2 different owners and they performed the work 3 years in a row taking such a huge hit on the job.  That's 2.5 days their guys are here working and losing money?  I feel like I am not getting the truth.  He claims that the employee who wrote the quotes was let go for writing bad estimates but I am just not really buying that a large company is that unorganized that they don't realize that mistake for 3 years.  \n\n\nDoes anyone disagree with me here?   I posted about this in the local moms Facebook group and one other woman said they doubled her prices as well and she went with another company and gave me their info.  I am having them come out Wednesday for an estimate.  I want to be fair to the original company because they have done a good job but this just seems like way too many red flags to me.    \n\n\nThanks for reading and any ideas you may have.",

Then find out what they will pay by shooting out test prices right out of the ass. And then find others similar the customer to marry your product or service to. Once you find a pattern, register an appropriate license get a bank account, hire an accountant a secretary and a driver.

I found on the internet through a newspaper a company dedicated to a service that is urgently needed in the place where I live, but to get to negotiate and contact that company I need someone. And I know the right person. The problem is that I don't want that someone who contacts them to keep all or a large part of the benefit, and I also don't want the final buyer of the service to end up avoiding me and make a direct purchase from that source. Let's say that I want to be the intermediary, since both the seller and the buyer do not know each other and would not know each other if it were not for me. I beg your pardon if I am ambiguous, it is for precaution. What should I do? An exclusive contract? Confidentiality contract? I am 25 years old and have a lot of uncertainties.",

Apparently, all of this was handled very badly, lots of data is missing and my department is doing all of the grunt work with little to no help from the branch. Also, the legislation in the UK is completely different from ours and my team has had to figure out with any help how to navigate it. \n\nFor what my colleages have told me, the director of this branch simply does not cooperate with them. He does not come to meetings and gives no reason, he will not answer to emails and even this week, a girl from my team went to London for 3 days and \"was only able\" to meet her the last day at 7 o clock in the morning for just one hour.  Tomorrow she is coming back and we are going to have a meeting about the trip. \n\nSo my question is why do you think this guy is behaving this way, which is apparently against his own interests?

Right now I only have 2 treats which I will be able to expand once I earn money to have a guaranteed analysis done on the other treat products I want to sell.

        "submission": "Once upon a time, in a world of rapidly evolving technology, a valuable resource was discovered - a resource that would change the course of history and redefine the way humans connect and interact. This resource was not buried deep within the earth or found in the depths of the ocean; it was hidden in plain sight, flowing through the very fabric of our lives: data.\n\nEvery human interaction, every digital footprint, and every online behavior, all contributed to this vast ocean of data. And just as oil had once been the lifeblood of the industrial revolution, data was now poised to become the driving force of the digital age. People began to realize that data, indeed, was the new oil.\n\nThe world's most powerful corporations quickly recognized the value of this resource. They harvested and refined it, using it to power their algorithms, drive their decision-making, and dominate the markets. But as the value of data grew, so did the power imbalance between the corporations and the individuals who generated this precious resource.\n\nIt was time for a change. People began to rally behind a new movement, one that sought to treat data as a commodity, empowering individuals to monetize their information and maintain control over their digital lives. This movement envisioned a world where data was not extracted and exploited without consent but rather, harnessed and shared in a way that benefited everyone.\n\nA new marketplace emerged, allowing individuals to lease or sell \"access rights\" to their data, just as oil companies had done with their resources for decades. This marketplace was built on a foundation of transparency, security, and trust, enabling users to control who had access to their information and under what terms.\n\nThe benefits of this new system were manifold. Consumers now had a way to monetize their data, generating additional income and providing a tangible return on the time and effort they invested in their digital lives. This newfound financial power gave rise to a new class of data entrepreneurs, who leveraged their data assets to create innovative products and services, further fueling the digital economy.\n\nSimultaneously, data-dependent industries reaped the rewards of a more equitable system. By gaining legitimate access to vast amounts of high-quality, consensual data, these industries were able to refine their algorithms, improve their products, and tailor their services to better meet consumer needs. This newfound synergy between consumers and corporations led to unprecedented levels of innovation and collaboration.\n\nAs the world embraced the concept of data as a commodity, it became clear that this was not only a viable means of monetization but also a powerful catalyst for change. By putting control back in the hands of individuals, the data revolution had not only disrupted the status quo but also laid the foundation for a more equitable, transparent, and prosperous digital future.\n\nIn this brave new world, data was no longer a tool for exploitation but rather, a force for empowerment. And as people continued to harness the power of their data, they unlocked new opportunities, forged new connections, and shaped a better world for generations to come.",
