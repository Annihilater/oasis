As the co-founder of Coursera, he brought world-class education online. As a former chief scientist at Baidu and a key player at Google Brain, he helped shape the deep learning revolution. Now, through DeepLearning.AI and AI Fund, he’s focused on making AI adoption easier for businesses that aren’t named Google. Whether he’s teaching millions through his legendary AI courses or breaking down complex tech into digestible insights, Ng is proof that AI doesn’t have to be a black box—at least, not if he’s explaining it.",
