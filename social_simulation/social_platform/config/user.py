# RESPONSE FORMAT
Your answer should follow the response format:

{{
    "reason": "your feeling about these tweets and users, then choose some functions based on the feeling. Reasons and explanations can only appear here.",
    "functions": [{{
        "name": "Function name 1",
        "arguments": {{
            "argument_1": "Function argument",
            "argument_2": "Function argument"
        }}

            "argument_2": "Function argument"
