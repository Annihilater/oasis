The first step in using OASIS is to generate user data. This section provides a detailed overview of how user data should be prepared for simulation.

## Data Formats

OASIS supports multiple social media platforms, each with its own data format. Note that the **type** of data format must align with the **DefaultPlatformType** or **RecsysType** specified for the platform.
### Twitter Format (CSV)

For Twitter simulations, OASIS stores user data in CSV files. Each user (agent) requires the following information:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **user_id** | A unique identifier assigned to each agent |
| **name** | The real name of the agent |
| **username** | The username of the agent within the system |
| **created_at** | The registration timestamp of the agent on the platform (agents will perform a sign-up action at the start of the simulation) |
| **following_agentid_list** | A list containing the IDs of other agents this user follows |
| **previous_tweets** | Initial tweets from the user, which are injected into the environment during simulation |
| **user_char** | A brief self-description of the agent (included in the agent's system prompt to establish an initial identity) |
| **description** | Similar to `user_char`, serving as the agent's self-description |

#### Example Twitter CSV Format

| user_id | name | username | following_agentid_list | previous_tweets | user_char | description |
|---------|------|----------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 14529063 | user_9 | user9 | [32] | ["hello world"] | Beach bum, web developer, nerd ðŸ¤“, crocheter, avid reader ðŸ“š, a singer in the shower, a notorious heart breaker. I blog about books @ https://t.co/JjnKtEnq4R | Beach bum, web developer, nerd ðŸ¤“, crocheter, avid reader ðŸ“š, a singer in the shower, a notorious heart breaker.

### Reddit Format (JSON)

For Reddit simulations, OASIS uses JSON files to store user data. Each user object contains the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **realname** | The real name of the agent |
| **username** | The username of the agent within the Reddit platform |
| **bio** | A brief bio displayed on the user's profile |
| **persona** | A detailed description of the agent's personality, interests, and background (used for the agent's system prompt) |
| **age** | The age of the agent |
| **gender** | The gender of the agent |
| **mbti** | Myers-Briggs Type Indicator of the agent |
| **country** | The country where the agent is based |
| **profession** | The agent's profession or field of work/study |
| **interested_topics** | An array of topics the agent is interested in |

#### Example Reddit JSON Format

```json
[
  {
    "realname": "James Miller",
    "username": "millerhospitality",
    "bio": "Passionate about hospitality & tourism. Exploring the world one destination at a time.",
    "persona": "James is a seasoned professional in the Hospitality & Tourism industry. With a knack for business and a keen interest in economics, he enjoys analyzing market trends and staying updated on the latest developments in the field.

    "age": 40,
    "gender": "male",
    "mbti": "ESTJ",
    "country": "UK",
    "profession": "Hospitality & Tourism",
    "interested_topics": [

      "Business"

  },

    "username": "emma_logistics_guru",
    "bio": "Passionate about transportation and logistics | ENFJ | Always seeking new connections and opportunities",
    "persona": "Emma Hayes is a 19-year-old logistics enthusiast currently studying Transportation, Distribution & Logistics.

Emma is always expanding her knowledge in the transportation industry and enjoys connecting with like-minded individuals to exchange ideas and insights.",
    "age": 19,
    "gender": "female",
    "mbti": "ENFJ",
    "country": "UK",
    "profession": "Transportation, Distribution & Logistics",
    "interested_topics": [
      "Culture & Society",
      "Business"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Preparing User Data

When preparing user data for OASIS, consider the following regardless of platform:

1. **Diverse Personalities**: Create agents with varied interests, opinions, and communication styles to simulate realistic social dynamics.

2. **Realistic Social Connections**: For Twitter, the `following_agentid_list` should reflect plausible social networks based on shared interests or characteristics. For Reddit, users with similar `interested_topics` may interact more frequently.

3. **Initial Content**: For Twitter, `previous_tweets` help establish the agent's voice. For Reddit, the `bio` and `persona` fields serve a similar purpose.

4. **Consistent Identity**: Ensure that the personality descriptors (`user_char` and `description` for Twitter; `bio` and `persona` for Reddit) align with the agent's intended personality and behavior in the simulation.

5. **Platform-Specific Behaviors**: Consider how users interact differently on Twitter versus Reddit. Twitter interactions are more brief and public, while Reddit discussions are often topic-focused and community-based.

In the next sections, we'll explore how to use this user data to configure and run simulations in OASIS for different platforms.
