# User Generation

The first step in using OASIS is to generate user data. This section provides a detailed overview of how user data should be prepared for simulation.

## Data Format

Currently, OASIS stores user data in CSV files. Each user (agent) in the simulation requires the following information:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **user_id** | A unique identifier assigned to each agent |
| **name** | The real name of the agent |
| **username** | The username of the agent within the system |
| **created_at** | The registration timestamp of the agent on the platform (agents will perform a sign-up action at the start of the simulation) |
| **following_agentid_list** | A list containing the IDs of other agents this user follows |
| **previous_tweets** | Initial tweets from the user, which are injected into the environment during simulation |
| **user_char** | A brief self-description of the agent (included in the agent's system prompt to establish an initial identity) |
| **description** | Similar to `user_char`, serving as the agent's self-description |

## Example CSV Format

| user_id | name | username | following_agentid_list | previous_tweets | user_char | description |
|---------|------|----------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 14529063 | user_9 | user9 | [32] | ["hello world"] | Beach bum, web developer, nerd ðŸ¤“, crocheter, avid reader ðŸ“š, a singer in the shower, a notorious heart breaker.

## Preparing User Data

When preparing user data for OASIS, consider the following:

1. **Diverse Personalities**: Create agents with varied interests, opinions, and communication styles to simulate realistic social dynamics.

2. **Realistic Social Connections**: The `following_agentid_list` should reflect plausible social networks based on shared interests or characteristics.

3. **Initial Content**: `previous_tweets` help establish the agent's voice and interests from the beginning of the simulation.

4. **Consistent Identity**: Ensure that `user_char` and `description` align with the agent's intended personality and behavior in the simulation.

In the next sections, we'll explore how to use this user data to configure and run simulations in OASIS.
